I'm thinking of using the apriori datamining algorithm for this. Seems like it might be a good thing to use for this.
Here's a link to a library to download:

A quick rundown of how it works:

Say you have a dataset with 10 elements...


id  title                       categories                  rating
1   lion king         adventure, comedy, drama, musical     5.0
2   scorpion king     action, adventure                     3.5
3   pulp fiction      action, psycological                  5.0
4   godzilla          monster, horror                       3.0
5   the prestige      thriller, psycological                4.5
6   swordfish         thriller, psycological, drama         4.0
7   se7en             action, psycological                  4.0
8   Rocky             action, drama                         4.0
9   A Clockwork Orange  drama, psycological                 4.0
10  The Waterboy    comedy, drama                           3.5


Say you watched Se7en. To get a recommendation, it will take every user that has watched Se7en, and find which other movie
is the most watched among that group. For example, say everyone that watched Se7en also watched pulp fiction. It will recommend
pulp fiction to our user that watched Se7en. Obviously not everyone that has watched Se7en has watched pulp fiction, so
we manually set in thresholds to grab say the top 5 movies. This could be our popularity metric.

If we want, we can modify the code to match only movies in the same categories and restrict it that way. We can also make it
only include movies with ratings above a certain threshold.

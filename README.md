# MXPO
MXPO is a movie suggestion knowledge engine. The engine will work by taking a user-entered movie and/or genre and generate suggestions for them based of many internal factors that are currently being determied. The finished product will (hopefully) be a [web UI hosted online](http://linsenbard.com/mxpo/).

# Setup
## Pandas
To visualize and find relationships between the data we collect, we plan on using [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). Installation instructions are on their site.

# CMAP
The CMAP for this engine is included in the main folder of the repository. Feel free to make any edits to it using [CmapTools](http://cmap.ihmc.us/).
